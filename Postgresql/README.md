# Postgresql
This is the postgresql homework.

The whole homework is divided into four files.
Here is a brief explanation of these files:

- First of all you have to run "tables.pgsql" to create required tables.
- Then you should run "functions.pgsql" to create the single function that is needed for the 7-th task.
- Now you are ready to check and run queries in "queries.pgsql".
- By the way, you can run "inserts.pgsql" to test queries.
