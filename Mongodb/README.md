# Mongodb
This is the mongodb homework.

Since mongodb is not a relational DBMS, there is no file for creating collections. Collections will be created by the time you insert data in them.

However, you can check how to insert data in each collection by checking "Schemas.json" file. There is an example for each collection in the file.

Whenever you created your collections, you can run queries on your database.
Queries are stored in "Queries.mongodb".
